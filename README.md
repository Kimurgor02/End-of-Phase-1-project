# End-of-Phase-1-project
At the end of every phase there is a project to be done. This project tests the knowledge of the students so far.
##Project objectives
1. Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.

2. Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

3. Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).

4. Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.

5. Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.
##Introduction
The project is about a currency converter. This will help us when we want to check the rates of different currencies against a certain currency.
It also helps us to quickly convert the currencies.
